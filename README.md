# easy_nextion_control
Nextion display functions that work in any Arduino project, without using Nextion libraries.
<p>This repo consists of code examples that show you <strong>How to control Nextion displays without any extra library</strong> using only functions.</p>
When I was developing a complex arduino project including the use of a <strong>3.2 Nextion display</strong> I had the need to save as much memory as I could to make it easier for other programmers to develop their modules without any memory concerns.<br> <br>
<p>So, searching through the internet and writing a bit of code I came up with the next group of functions that make it easy for me and my coworkers to understand what the Nextion was comanded to do and the state in which it was.</p>
